**Predicting Medical Appointment No-Shows**

This project focuses on Feature analysis whether a patient will show up for a medical appointment based on various factors such as patient demographics, appointment scheduling details, and other relevant information. The dataset used in this project is "KaggleV2-May-2016.csv", which contains information about medical appointments in Brazil.

**Setup and Dependencies**

Before running any code, ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

    Python (3.7 or later)
    Pandas
    NumPy
    Matplotlib
    Seaborn
    Scikit-learn

Install the required dependencies using pip:

**Data Exploration**

In the beginning, the project performs data exploration to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset. The following steps are taken:

   **Ignore Generated Warning Messages:** We suppress warning messages to ensure a clean display of outputs.

   **Enable Interactive Plots:** Magic command is used to enable interactive plots in the notebook interface.

   **Importing Dependencies:** All necessary libraries are imported, such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

   **Load Data:** The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, and the first three rows are displayed to perform a sanity check.

   **Descriptive Analysis:** Descriptive analysis involves summarizing and describing the main features of the dataset. Measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and other summary statistics are calculated. Additionally, the number of missing values is checked. The datetime variables are processed upon loading.

   **Data Cleaning**

Before diving into exploratory analysis, some data cleaning is performed:

   **Column Partitioning:** Columns are partitioned into different groups based on their data types (continuous, categorical, and datetime).

   **Unnecessary Columns Removal:** Columns like "AppointmentID" and "PatientId" are removed as they are not useful for predictive modeling.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

The EDA phase involves creating various plots and charts to gain insights into the data and identify potential areas for further investigation:

   **Univariate Plots:** Univariate plots visualize the distribution and frequency of values in a single variable. Histograms are used for continuous variables, while bar charts are used for categorical variables.

   **Multivariate Plots:** Multivariate plots show the relationship between multiple variables. Interaction between each feature and the target variable ("No-show") is examined using histograms and bar charts.

**Feature Engineering**

   **Feature Engineering:** Some new features are created based on datetime variables to gain further insights and improve predictive modeling. "Waitingtime" is calculated as the absolute difference in days between "ScheduledDay" and "AppointmentDay". Months, weekdays, days, hours, and minutes are extracted from datetime variables. And finally we encode all the rest of the categorical features to get a numerical datasets.


**Conclusion**

The README file outlines the steps taken in this project to explore, clean, and analyze the medical appointment dataset. It provides a comprehensive overview of the data, highlighting the relationships between various features and the target variable ("No-show"). Additionally, it shows the creation of new features through feature engineering for predictive modeling. The next step in the project would be preprocessing, feature selection, model building, and evaluation to create a predictive model for medical appointment no-shows.
